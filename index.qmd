Welcome! This is your Quarto site on GitHub Pages.

- Write math with `$e^{i\pi}+1=0$` or display blocks:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2\,dx = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

- Add citations by including a `references.bib` file and putting `bibliography: references.bib` in the post front matter.

ðŸ‘‰ New posts go in the `posts/` folder as `.qmd` files.
